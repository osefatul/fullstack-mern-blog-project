# Full-Stack MERN Blog

## Creating Blog from the Scratch
 We have use ReactJs, NodeJs, Node-Api, React Hooker and many more packages.
 - We have created first multiple pages, as each page is composed of react component
	- #### Write: this page will be used in order to write a post.
	- #### Home: this page is the home page of the blog. here you will be able to see all the posts and mani menue.

## Rest API with MongoDB
 We used express for server, mongoose for linking mongoDB with the backend, env for all those url to hide.
	- mongoDB: we used atlasMDB for databas and users. create a new cluster and user account.
	- env: in the env file of api we saved the link of connection that we got from the cluster.
 
 In order to understand mongoose in details click on the link https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html
 After connection to MongoDB, we created models - POST,CATEGORY AND USER, and Routes - post,categories,user and authentication.

 
 ### MongoDB
 MongoDB is a database that stores your data as documents. Most commonly these documents resemble a JSON-like structure.
 
 ### What Is Mongoose?
 Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper (ODM). This means that Mongoose allows you to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document.
 Mongoose provides an incredible amount of functionality around creating and working with schemas. Mongoose currently contains eight SchemaTypes that a property is saved as when it is persisted to MongoDB. They are:

 - String
 - Number
 - Date
 - Buffer
 - Boolean
 - Mixed
 - ObjectId
 - Array

 Each data type allows you to specify:

 - a default value
 - a custom validation function
 - indicate a field is required
 - a get function that allows you to manipulate the data before it is returned as an object
 - a set function that allows you to manipulate the data before it is saved to the database
 - create indexes to allow data to be fetched faster

 ### Express
 Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications. Following are some of the core features of Express framework âˆ’

	- Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
	- Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.
	- Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
 
 ### bcrypt
 we are using this library so the password that is posting in the database should be encrypted.
